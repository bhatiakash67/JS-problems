## Introduction

This repository is a reflection of my commitment to mastering JavaScript through hands-on practice. I believe in the power of problem-solving to reinforce concepts, improve coding skills, and build a solid foundation for real-world applications.

## Problem-solving Approach

My approach to solving JavaScript problems involves:

- Understanding the problem statement thoroughly.
- Planning and pseudocode to break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
- Writing clean and efficient JavaScript code.
- Testing and debugging to ensure the correctness of the solution.
- Reflecting on the problem and seeking optimizations.

## Concepts Explored
